# Ross Slater
### Earth Observation PhD Student

Hello I'm Ross 👋, a final year Earth observation 🌍🛰️ and Glaciology PhD student at the University of Leeds, part of the [SENSE Centre for Doctoral Training
](https://eo-cdt.org/)

My reserach uses Sentinel-1🛰️ SAR imagery to measure changes in the flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet 🇦🇶🧊, and other enviromnental datasets 💨☀☀️❄❄️🌊 to investigate potential drivers of long- and short-term variability. 

I mainly work in Python - I'm really interested in big data processing for Earth observation and using the Pangeo software stack.
