## Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Ross a final year Earth observation 🌍🛰️ PhD student at the University of Leeds, part of the [SENSE Centre for Doctoral Training
](https://eo-cdt.org/)

My reserach uses Sentinel-1🛰️ SAR imagery to measure changes in the flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) 🇦🇶🧊. I mainly work in python and I'm really interested in big data in Earth observation and using the Pangeo software stack.
